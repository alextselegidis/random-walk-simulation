## Random Walk Simulation (Solar Photon) - Three.js ##
This project simulates the solar photon random walk model where photons follow random paths as they escape from the sun. During their journey they collide with each other resulting in changing directions constantly. This means that a single photon will need hundreds of thousands of years to reach the surface and continue to outer space. Until now physicists have not reach to an agreement about the constants that rule the particular model, but we are able to simulate the process in order to experience this phenomenon.

## About The Project ##
This is a personal experiment for rendering 3D shapes on browser by using [three.js](http://threejs.org). You can find a live demo here: (http://alextselegidis.com/random-walk-simulation).
